fallible allocators, cancellable allocators, async allocators, yielding allocators, backpressure, functorial/applicative allocators?, (both alloc and free)
pointer compression / indexing, arenas, ...
support for 2-phase / 'reserve ticket' stuff, for eg 'alloc from DMA'

file format needs three variants: index-at-front, index-at-end, and index-somewhere; index-at-front is the nicest, index-at-end is okay and there so that you can put other stuff at the front, index-somewhere is gross and to be avoided, but is there so that you can put the so/exe in a file that needs to have stuff at the front and at the end. 'index-somewhere' is inspired by zip.

Approach: Haskell star-exec, star-compiletime-linker, star-loadtime-linker, star-loader, star-runtime-linker-and-loader, star-assembler; get them done fast enough to outrun the quicksand etc. Then build new version of themselves in star-assembler, with the catch that we also need to be able to make elf-stub-contained versions of star-loader, and a 'fully static star' version of 'star-loadtime-linker', and a 'no runtime loading and linking' version of star-runtime-linker-and-loader.

Build time vs run time
- Macros via staging (at build time)

Overlay ABI to allow for languages to have their own way of doing things 'on top'

the struct linker idea can be taken further
fixup directives and fixup locations, to allow for more than just 'add cases to a struct or enum'.
Should be able to use it for 'semi-generic' functions etc as well - like, a kind of semi-monomorphisation when added to some complicated lto / linker scripts
dlopen become difficult though - maybe do something with 'late initialisation' or something, so you can mark sections to be linked and runnable after some stuff has been done, and then instead of dlopen you can use 'add link' and then 'make into executable image, and potentially bring into address space etc', with some kind of 'here is how we fixup symbols for that, and where we throw a condition if trying to jump into an unrealised sub-image'

stack discipline fn
coro
inside out

function and coroutine and closure pointers that are callable / etc

functorial modules

Something about symbol/name lookup, versions, functoriality, fixups
Something about runtime type information / etc

A way to do 'rich generics' which is slower / etc, goes through vtables and name mangling and  extra linker shit etc
→ This can possibly be on a 'per language' basis, require an extra runtime, etc etc
→ You can have multiple in a single .so
→ You can also have the parts of the .so which don't rely on that, which you can use 'raw'
→ Something something Meta-Object Protocol

Would need Rust's borrow checker or equivalent though - can we do this with separate compilation like this?
Or even a weaker thing, like a way to say 'you/we/they/same-as-whatever-x-does have to handle allocation/deallocation'
Or a stronger thing, like 'here is our semi-ring adjoint modal logic'
Destructors
Signals
Async

fixed size, may be available in hardware, otherwise software: uN, iN, flN, fiN, bool, fmN_M (the 'tensor of small floats which share a mantissa' representation)
platform specific size: usize, isize, item_pointer, function_pointer, closure_pointer, coroutine_pointer
sum (eg discriminated union), product (eg struct), 'multiple interpretation' (eg union)

executable image, shared object, object, .a, ... can we do all of them as header, section* {header, data, index}, index..., with different headers and sections and so on, but overall the same logical structure?

[T; N], [T; N, M, ...], +-*/<>=∨∧¬≠ pow_n log_n root_n -> 
on stack, on heap
in, out, inout, multiple return
inner name:outer name for args; either one or both can be _ for positional
args can be ? (for optional), * (for zero or more), or + (for one or more)

Way to do binary layout of objects
Way to do 'generic parameters' which can be preconditions etc
Look up what swift can do for optional arguments, varargs, varstructs, default args, constructors, destructors, getters and setters, runtime and compile time introspection (not just of types, names symbols, but also things like memory/allocation, pages, etc)


lua alike for embedding, with ... as embedder ABI, plus meta-lua alike for staging metaprogramming / exposing more stuff at the ABI level
or maybe a Dylan or Rebol or Io or Ioke or Factor or Icon or Unicon or Mozart/Oz or Potion or AppleScript/HyperTalk or Visual Basic or Delphi/Object Pascal or...

how to add MOP/etc, runtime, ...

---

linker as part of metaprogramming
separate module compilation, but also lto

---

ABI has two parts
independent
instruction set+OS+etc specific part (eg x86_64/linux, wasm/wasi, wasm/web, 68k/classicmacos, x86_64/win10)

The container format allows you to have sections by 'instruction set+OS+etc specific part', so you can have eg different versions of a named thing depending on that
But also, it can be by vm bytecode (for some particular VM), wasm, programming language source code for some particular language, ...
You could have the language runtime + embedded language interpreter as native code section, then the language code in a language code section, and load libraries etc of that language code through linking and loading

assembler:

sections
names

types: native code also specifies instruction set and operating system

---

names

data type definitions - partials are here too, and fixups can reference this and other imported data type definitions etc for fixups
function (etc - eg coro, closure, etc) signatures / entrypoints - need to be a HAMT or etc in the image, something that is fast to seek/search/iterate
linkage stuff - fixups, partials


maybe move signatures over to data type definitions, and then have 'preinitialised/constant' and 'entrypoint' hamts?
for both data type definitions and function etc signatures

no, have 'data type definitions' which includes things like 'types of functions' etc as well obviously; then also have 'callsites' and 'data sections / labels for where data is / etc' and 'coroutine sites' etc which are named and have a type defined in the 'data type definitions'.
sections:
- data type definitions
- callsite/cocallsite(eg callsite plus state site)/label/etcs (names, reference to data type definitions, reference to locations/s in loadable-code-as-such/loadable-preinitialised-data-sections-as-such section)
- loadable-code-as-such
- initialisers-of-various-kinds
- loadable-preinitialised-data-sections-as-such
- reactive/dataflow/streaming/pushpull/etc section
- debugging information
- bundled interpretable source code (including language indicator information)
- marked 'runtime' section, which is similar to but distinct from a loadable-code-as-such section or an initialisers-of-various-kinds section
- fixups section
- fixups, data type definitions, and loadable code as such can mark that it depends on initialisers-of-various-kinds/runtimes/bundled interpretable source code etc; so you can generate a .so for my lualike (with the nice methods), but also you can generate a .so for my lualike code, with compile time lualike code to define what the exported symbols etc are, so you get them as nice methods etc in the file itself; but they just won't 'work' until the dependencies are run etc

names for things are binary blobs of the form length (as some kind of uleb or vlq, in bits):value.

And when you try to cross call etc you look up via the name and signature

different stack disciplines for function calls
asm literal (by ISA) etc
but also ... stack machine shit
eg word $x -- int int -> string int bool ⦃on stack $z at location $a⦄

sizes, ...

loads, stores, jumps, calls (stack discipline etc), cocalls (stack discipline plus also state machine for yields), call with environment, environment capture, 

inner/outer/both inner and outer/external, namespaces, 'direct binding to a specific file', 'pure signature' eg an 'interface .so' to typecheck etc against but which does not have the loadable code in it - can be used for eg having an 'interface' to load a library against and 'just use' as ~normal (though fixups become maybe an issue - need to think about dependencies)

not 'static linking' vs 'dynamic linking' vs 'dload', but rather 'compile time linking' (consolidation into a single file and running fixups etc on the file itself) vs 'load time linking' (star-exec reads dependencies, and reads in more files, and runs the fixups on the process image) vs 'run time linking' (the program itself reaches out to ...) in the 'staged programming' sense; initialiser sections, dependencies, and runtimes also add more layers to this

maybe we need page instructions and etc as well - eg to make this section a small wrx page, whereas these other sections are large rx pages and this one is a large rw page

for the various loadable code sections: ISA (plus family, version, features), platform (eg kernel version dependencies, underlying runtime version dependencies), 'style' (eg fastcall, ccall, pcall, gnu) - for some of these, we need ∧∨¬ (plus features) and you provide a selector that gets matched against
%emit {
  %index first
  %section blah
  %padding to next page alignment
  %section blah
  %section blah
  %section blah
}

%emit {
  %zeros to mmmmmmm //or %zeros num nnnnnnn
  %section blah
  %padding to 64 bit alignment
  %section blah
  %section blah
  %section blah
  %zeros to nnnnnnn //or %zeros num nnnnnnn
  %index-last
}

%emit {
  %zeros to mmmmmmm //or %zeros num nnnnnnn
  %section blah
  %padding to 1024 byte alignment
  %section blah
  %section blah
  %section blah
  %zeros to nnnnnnn //or %zeros num nnnnnnn
  %index-middle
  %zeros to ppppppp //or %zeros num nnnnnnn
}

%section name: blah, type: hashtable {
}

%section name: blah, type: linear-code, isa: x86_64, cc: funcall {
}

section location - index, file location, process image location, or ???

Things needed

initial haskell (or etc) datastructure representing the image ⇆ binary and text representations
- this also includes quite a bit more than might be apparent, as the text rep of various of the ISA code parts in various sections are in assembly
haskell functions to eg load segements, run fixups, etc
a haskell program to use as the initial star-exec for

```bash
sudo mount binfmt_misc -t binfmt_misc /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc
echo ":star:E::★::/bin/star-exec:POC" > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register
```


---

function def
  %asm
  %call $name
  or
  %parts of the argument packing that need done
  %no-pack-call $name
end

coro

closure
coclosure
trampoline
signal/dataflow/etc variable (pull, push, sync, async, etc)
lvars
generic functions / selectors / etc
delegation
aliases
first class labels (both ways), like the whole 'path' thing from Swift
vtables
prototypal classes, classical oop classes, MOP, etc

threads...
threadlocals...

... handlers for signals

data structure declaration
bits, padding, bitarrays, etc
pointer
sum, product, coproduct, first class label, ...
bitstealing made legal

fixups for eg dstructs (eg generate linker stuff too)

names have
modules/scopes:name.(arg_name:arg_type:specifiers)*..version

The various ways to implement 'classes', and how to layer 'language ABI' over the top, like a better version of the C++ name mangling to put it on top of the C ABI.

---

Maybe:
- define a way to define layout + ~interpretation
flat [] with dimension/s, pointer, direct incorporation, stride, alignment+padding, 'ordering' (eg row major, column major, (etc for ijkl-etc, where for n dimensions you have ), morton, z, bitplane, banked, etc)
generic type (when inside a scope where a thing is generic, ...; but you can directly use pointing and so on, as they don't depend on layout), 'unknown layout'
sum (discriminated union or labelled sum), product (tuple or struct), union (eg 'it could be one of these things, who knows?' - the 'one of these I guess' quantifier)
function, closure, environment (related to closure, eg the capture), coroutine, state-machine (related to the coroutine), coclosure (a closure that can yield, with a state and an environment)
(inner function, inner closure, inner coro, inner co-closure, etc etc; as well as the way to do 'escaping' eg downward funargs of these, trampolines, tail calls, ...)
how to do 'const sections', embedded data that can be exported with a name etc

unknown with size T and alignment U

controls for heap, stack, 'MMIO'/etc

all names are either
(with word size x) a u16 of the length followed by that many words of bits, written length:contents. The length is a part of the name; zero padding is significant. Eg 1:0, 2:0, 3:0 etc are all different names.
or some tbd text representation
Namespaces exist and can be nested etc. Namespaces are written with a '.', so 1:a2.2:fff2 is a name, which is distinct from eg 1:fe.2:fff2

---

Defining 'shapes'
Defining what signatures result in what kind of stack+register definition (where signatures involve passing in/out shapes etc)
The 'generics' stuff
Names (as len:binary)
External dictionaries that let you have multiple 'human-readable' keys for names, so you can do bidirectional lookup (though it is many to one, as in many human readible ways to refer to any given name, but each human readible way can only correspond to a single name)
Namespaces, and also maybe scopes
Fixups (both 'into' and 'out of', eg for dstruct definition and dstruct use, but more general)
(Other linker stuff, including static vs dynamic vs runtime eg dload)

---

callbacks

get
set
call

get_function(name) → a function pointer for the thing
can use generics for ...

monomorphisation via ~currying/~partial application - eg you can fix some of the 'generics' and then generate that. And you can choose it, as it will have a different signature.

---

Type definition: Name or _num, generics, signature, representation (could be just ISA+ABI, could be something else like a literal representation)

Actual thing definition: Name or _num, type (from Type definition), location, extent


→ A function definition is just an actual thing with the type of a function
→ A 'data definition' is just an actual thing with the type of data

---


'interfaces' implemented by a generic T can just be generic structs, eg

struct Action«T» {
  do_it: *(fn (T, State) -> Fallible«State, ActionErr»),
  is_doable: *(fn (T, State) -> bool),
}

struct Container«Outer, Inner» {
  map: *(fn (Outer, *(fn (Inner) -> Inner)) -> Outer),
  get: *(fn (Outer, usize) -> Inner),
}

const struct List_vtable«T» {
  mapcar: *(fn (List«T», *(fn (T) -> T)) -> List«T») = *list::mapcar,
  car: *(fn (List«T») -> Option«T») = *list::car,
  cdr: *(fn (List«T») -> List«T») = *list::cdr,
  cons: *(fn (T, List«T») -> List«T») = *list::cons,
}

enum List«T» {
  Nil,
  Cons(*T, *List«T»),
}

fn operating_on_containers«A, T: Container«T, A»»(T) -> A
called as
operating_on_containers«bool, List«bool»: List_vtable«bool».mapcar⇒Container«List«bool», bool».map»(a)

struct Action { ... }

fn foo«T»(it: T, vtable: Container«T, Action») { //List doesn't actually 'show up' in the signature here (other than as 'T'), as it is dealt with by passing in the 'here is a vtable object for as-if T was a Container'
  if let Some(third) = vtable.get(it, 3) {
    ...
  } else {
    ...
  }
}

fn get_from_list«T»(it: List«T», which: usize) -> Option«T» {
  if which == 0 {
    return List_vtable«T».car(it);
  } else {
    return get_from_list«T»(List_vtable«T».cdr(it));
  }
}

let list_as_container«T» = Container«List«T», T» {
  map: List_vtable«T».mapcar,
  get: *get_from_list,
};

let g = foo(*list, list_as_container);

Container«List«T», T».map = List«T».mapcar;
Something about ???/fixed

needs to be a way to say that the struct List«T» is 'the same' as the data it is 'for' - in this case, the enum List«T»
like, a way to pass around the enum, but to have the struct as a const that is there whenever you need it from the enum
yes, I am just redescribing a from-first-principles vtables...
or maybe not... like, the thing does not need to be passed in when you non-generically know the thing, only when it is generic and so you don't know it... the equivalent of 'yes, this does implement this interface' type stuff...

The key is this https://docs.werwolv.net/pattern-language ImHex pattern language as the seed for a general description language that can be used to build assemblers/disassemblers; plugging in to my 'ISA simulator construction kit' as a generation target for the assembers/disassemblers.

And then macroassembly stuff can be done librarywise by importing/composing together more things in this language.
The question is whether I can do this in a 'the view from the left' type way and/or a datalog-y way and/or a levy# like way all living in the positively-typed/non-computational fragment.

Memory: Ram, Rom, file, stream, disk...
cells with sizes and addresses for all except stream; stream is packets with size?

As 'headers' - eg specifying names (and properties, and other related things that languages might need to query against for how to handle things) and ABI details.
The specifics per-function - eg we don't need the C ABI conceit of 'universal rules for C header line to stack discipline / register stuff', as instead of providing a C header and then people have to parse it and figure it out, we provide the names/etc plus a machine fprmat for specifying those details. So eg you can have multiple calling conventions exposed within one interface, and your language can decide on its own within-language calling convention, but still generate reasonable code to call other language functions etc.

(ijk-permutation is the general way to talk about row major, column major, etc when dealing with n dimensions)

The abstract way: [] (and stride/sparsity/ijk-permutation/order(eg morton/z, normal, other)), size, T, ∀∃ıλ etc, ∧∨¬∪→←∈∋, as well as ~primitives like uN, iN, fN, and the various complexities around pointer and usize/iseze, etc
The concrete way: what named things are packed where and how, which registers are fucked with in which way, how the stack or stacks are manipulated, thread locals, etc etc (specifications per ISA)
Eg

ISA has registers {sp, rx, mx, rg, r1, r2, r3, ...}...
- registers clobbered
- registers untouched
- registers used to pass things in
- registers used to pass thigns out
ISA has stack/stacks
- how to get, push, pop, check, etc stack or stacks (as-arch, stack-pointer-register: $reg; grow-direction: $up-or-down; red-zone: $val-or-NA; alloc-more-stack: $details, call-routine $personality, cactus-stack stuff, forth-style-stack stuff)


---

Just headers.
Headers plus the code the headers are for with interfaces only exterior.
Headers plus the code the headers are for plus interior interfaces eg the internal names and stuff for the code to do stuff dynamically with itself.

You can have multiple rounds of this, with different ways of aggregateing and disaggregating. Some of the transformations require language-aware tools or are not reversable; others (those that are the equivalent of joining archives while maintaining separate sections) are.

Individual sections can be split or joined, but that requires ... (basically can't have inlined across the split; everything must be able to be turned into an exterior interface).
So must be able to specify and query that kind of thing.


For ISAs, should be able to additionally specify things like feature flags. Need to be able to fast query, do function body selection based on, etc etc.
